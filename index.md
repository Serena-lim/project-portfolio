# Child Mortality Analysis  
*Interactive Report with Live Plotly Figures*

## Introduction

Child mortality rate is defined as the probability of a child dying before reaching age five. It remains a key indicator of a country’s public health conditions and broader socio-economic development. In this project, we analyze historical trends in child mortality and explore whether economic development, measured by GDP per capita, is associated with lower child mortality across countries. Moreover, we analyze the causes of child mortality and the relationship between child mortality and poverty in different countries.

We used four datasets from Our World in Data (OWID):

- **Child mortality rate:** yearly child mortality rate for all countries  
- **Child mortality & GDP per capita:** child mortality rates paired with GDP per capita  
- **Child mortality vs extreme poverty:** mortality vs share living in extreme poverty  
- **Causes of death in children under 5:** multiple causes of death among children  

### Research Questions

1. How has child mortality changed over time from 1957 to 2023 for selected countries?  
2. Is there a correlation between GDP per capita and child mortality across countries?  
3. Is there a connection between the causes of child mortality and extreme poverty?

### Analytical Approach

- Visualize long-run trends using a line chart  
- Build a regression model to test correlation between GDP per capita and child mortality  
- Compare causes of child mortality with extreme poverty rates using categorized plots
